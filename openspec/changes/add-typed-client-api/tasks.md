## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Inventory documented public methods from docs/client/apidocs.rst and map to code locations.
- [ ] 1.2 Define shared typing primitives (TypedDicts, Literals, enums) for known fields used across APIs.
- [ ] 1.3 Update documented client-core signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.4 Update documented project-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.5 Update documented jobs-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.6 Update documented spiders-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.7 Update documented collections-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.8 Update documented frontiers-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.9 Update documented activity-related signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.10 Update documented items/logs/requests/samples signatures and return types.
- [ ] 1.11 Preserve backwards compatibility via internal helpers when explicit public parameters replace **params.
- [ ] 1.12 Add/update docstrings as needed to reflect typed parameters and return shapes.
- [ ] 1.13 Validate that no undocumented modules were modified.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Run existing tests (or the minimal targeted subset) and record results.
- [ ] 2.2 Run any OpenSpec validation required for the change.
